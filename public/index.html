        <p class="m-4">
            ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Adam, a technology leader from North East England, with over 15 years experience in the
            tech industry.
        </p>

        <p class="m-4">
            Currently serving as the driving force behind technology at <a href="https://opia.com" class="no-underline text-red-700 hover:underline font-bold">OPIA</a>,
            I lead a remarkable team of engineers and creatives who design and build everything we do, including our
            best-in-class Opia Cloud platform, tailor-made client solutions, internal systems, and the comprehensive
            infrastructure required to support a thriving business with over 200 employees and millions of customers.
        </p>

        <p class="m-4">
            While my roots lie in software engineering, my career journey has allowed me to become an authority in many tech domains,
            such as data/BI, cloud computing, infrastructure, business systems, enterprise architecture, cybersecurity, and more.
        </p>

        <p class="m-4">
            My passion is still software engineering, where I still love to get hands-on from time to time - usually getting involved when
            my teams need help solving the hardest problems. These days I spend the majority of my time in a leadership
            capacity where my job is to set a clear vision and strategy for the team, then empower, motivate, and support
            my talented team to deliver.
        </p>

        <p class="m-4">
            True to the techie stereotype, I've nurtured a collection of small side-projects over the years - which
            keeps my practical skills sharp - and I've been successful enough to have a few of them acquired along the way.
        </p>

        <p class="m-4">
            You can reach me on email at <span class="rounded-sm bg-slate-300 font-mono p-2 text-sm" onmouseover="this.textContent = atob('YWRhbW5pY2hvbHNvbjEwQGdtYWlsLmNvbQ==')">(hover to reveal)</span> if you'd like to connect.

    <!--
        Hello there, welcome to the source of adamnicholson.co.uk !

        This site was thrown together using Tailwind CSS with a load of inline styles thrown on top
        for things like images -- with the aim of being easy to put together, only a couple of source
        files, and without any build tools/dependencies.

        In other words, it's a bit slapdash.

        Please don't judge based on how this site is built -- if you'd like to speak to me about the
        right way to build something important, drop me an email.

        -- Cheers, Adam
